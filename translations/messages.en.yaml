about-me:
  title: About me
  description: <p class="pt-3">
    I am a <b>Computer Science Engineer</b> graduated by Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona in 2017.
    I have been focused in web development since my last university year and sometime in the near future
    I also want to start with app development.
    </p>
    <p class="pt-3">
    On the professional side, I am always hungry for new knowledge and skills and somehow that is the reason I have created my own web.
    My objective is to keep learning new things, basically in web and app development on both ends (front and back),
    and to update this website with everything that I learn; coding languages, new technologies, good practices,
    useful frameworks and components, app development, clean and solid code and many more things. For now, I will focus on:<br>
    <b>Symfony framework using PHP, HTML, CSS, jQuery and JS</b><br>
    <b>iOS app development</b>
    </p>
    <p class="pt-3">
    On the personal side, I consider myself a techie person who likes cutting-edge technologies and innovations.
    My other top hobbies are cinema, music, books and basketball. These hobbies made me who I am today.<br>
    I consider myself a team player, I really value helping those around you, hard work and commitment.
    I'm a positive person and I think being open-minded and empathic and having moral values is very important.
    </p>
    <p class="pt-3">
    Welcome to my site and ...<br>
    <b>Thank you for your time!</b>

    albert-aregall:
      description: Web project developed for the architect Albert Aregall.<br/><br/>
        The project was thought as a single page to show his multiple projects where images are
        the most important input for the user and Albert's contact information is always visible.
        The design was created by <a href="https://www.jorgebraun.design/" target="_blank">Jorge Braun</a>,
        a UX/UI product designer with a powerful web development background.<br>
        The main goal of this project was to create a fully renovated professional web page where Albert
        could show his portfolio of projects using images and renders of his own. We thought this was the
        best way to attract his potential clients, just showing them what he can offer and his more than
        relevant work in the architecture's world.
      development: Developed with Pimcore 6
      date: July 2020
    josep-mateu:
      description: Web project developed for RACC's President and CEO, Josep Mateu.<br/><br/>
        The project was thought as a redesign from his previous personal website.<br>
        The main goal of this project was to refactor his actual single page to show updated information
        about Josep Mateu and his work and preceded by a slider of images of him. In the catalan and
        spanish versions the user could also find a link to his candidacy for the RACC 2020 elections.
      development: Developed with Symfony 4
      date: September 2020
    vincle-studio:
      description: Web project developed for the architect and interior designer Sergi PÃ©rez.<br/><br/>
        The project was thought as a full company web page that has four main parts all of them accessible
        from the menu, as we thought the main page to be only a "Welcome" page.<br/>
        The first one contains an overview of all the architectural projects designed and developed
        by the company. Each one of the projects has its own page with more detailed information like;
        the client it was done for, what type of project is, its location or a description about the project
        alongside with some photos, renders and plans.<br/>
        The second one is an overview of collaborations done for some other companies or clients basically
        centered on interior redesign. Those contain the renders and some information about the collaboration.<br/>
        The third and fourth ones are related to the company itself. One is based on the description of
        the studio and the other one contains some contact information.<br/>
        The web was developed to be accessible in spanish and english.
