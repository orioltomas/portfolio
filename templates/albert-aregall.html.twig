                        Web project developed for the architect Albert Aregall.<br/><br/>
                        The project was thought as a single page to show his multiple projects where images are
                        the most important input for the user and Albert's contact information is always visible.
                        The design was created by <a href="https://www.jorgebraun.design/" target="_blank">Jorge Braun</a>,
                        a UX/UI product designer with a powerful web development background.
                        The main goal of this project was to create a fully renovated professional web page where Albert
                        could show his portfolio of projects using images and renders of his own. We thought this was the
                        best way to attract his potential clients, just showing them what he can offer and his more than
                        relevant work in the architecture's world.
